# ARAY
***ARAY â€” world's first demotivational, bitchy, code-switching, voice-transforming, wannabe clock.***

Speaking clock

Intro-level concatenative speech synthesis
Created in Google Colab with access to Google Drive

Needed: audio files of numbers 0-20, 30, 40, 50, and of "am" and "pm". We also included an empty audio file to extend silences where necessary. Additionally, we created an introductory sentence (zero_audio) for _sassiness_.
